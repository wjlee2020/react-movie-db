# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I learned and practiced
It's always fun fetching data (am I the only one?) and mapping it on to a grid.

## TMDB
You can get your own API key from The Movie DataBase (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### To-do
- separate business logics to own utils component
- create favorite state + favorite pages (with react-router-dom)
